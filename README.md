# ruweird.zsh-theme
My custom zsh theme.
It has a nice umbrella. It rains when there are errors!
Shows error code (if not zero), and current path.
The colors are purple-ish, to match the umbrella vibe.

I have the file in my ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes folder.
To use it I edit my ~/.zshrc file, and do the following:

ZSH_THEME="ruweird"

I use this repository to access this custom theme in new devices.
Feel free to try it yourself.
